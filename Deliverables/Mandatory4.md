#Oblig 4

##task 1

* Introduce a test role:
    * Steffen will cover the test role.
* The team thinks the choices made are good, and have no complaints.
* The group dynamics are all around good.
* Communication over slack and appear.in works beautifully.
* So far we have working on tasks that the person wants to work on, but with the changes on the assignment everyone has to work on a bit on everything.
Which is a challange to adapt to work we are not used to. Communication is summed up in the previous subtask.
* Things to improve upon: 
    * Everyone needs to get more familar with drawing artistic sprites.
    * Creating packets is something everyone should know.
    * Everyone needs to understand the gui drawing of the client
*
